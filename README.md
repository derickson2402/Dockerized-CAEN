I started working on this project while taking EECS-281, in order to make debugging my programs easier. I am sharing this project online in hopes that others will find it useful, but note that I don't have much free time to develop this project.

With that said, if you have an idea that would make this project even better, feel free to log an issue or submit a Pull Request. I greatly appreciate any help on developing this project!
